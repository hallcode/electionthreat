            summary: "A General Election takes place once every 5 years in all parts of the UK, and elects 650 members of the House of Commons, who represent the people of the UK and have the power to make or unmake any laws. It is the most important type of election as the party with the highest number of elected MPs after the election has control of the UK government.",
            when: "Since the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, the date of UK General Elections has been fixed. Prior to this, they took place whenever the Prime Minister asked the Queen to dissolve parliament (or when the government resigned, or a few other sets of circumstances. Now though, elections mainly only happen on their scheduled date. The first under the new law was 2015, however the House of Commons can vote to hold an election early, as happened in 2017 - meaning the next election will happen in 2022... presuming no further snap elections are called.",
            who: "The election takes place in all parts of the UK. To vote you have to be 18 on the day of the poll, a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen, be resident at an address in the UK (or a UK citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years).",
